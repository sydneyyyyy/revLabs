/*
 * Classes:
 * 		- represent real world things
 * 		- serve the role of a software module (collections of related methods and their necessary variables)
 * 
 * As real-world representation:
 * 		- Each 'instance' of a class (what we refer to as an object) represents a single 'thing'
 * 		- i.e. Two cars of the same make/model, but with different VINs, color, mileage, etc..
 * 
 * As a software module:
 * 		- Generally we only create one instance of the class at a time.
 * 		- TestClass - 
 * 
 * A class is a blueprint for objects
 * 		- it outlines behaviors and shared states for instances
 * 		- values of those states may change independently of the other instances (*).
 * 
 * An object's state is unique to itself.
 * Each object operates its own behavior independently. (*)
