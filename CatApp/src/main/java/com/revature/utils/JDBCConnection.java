/*
 * JDBC = Java Database Connectivity -> a java library with classes to connect to a database
 *  - with JDBC we can set up a connection that will use our RDS credentials
 *  - once we have that connection - we can make queries and execute statements
 *  
 * Steps:
 * 1. Add the JDBC dependency to our project (pom.xml)
 * 2. Set up a connection file using our credentials
 * 3. Refacter our DAOs (or create them) that will make calls to our database when needed
 * 		- DAO = Data Access Object - Objects meant for accessing data
 * 
 * Notable Interfaces of JDBC:
 * 
 * Connection Interface - represents established connections to our RDS -> the main gateway to interact with DB
 * 
 * Statement Interface - we won't use this (because it's not protected against SQL injection
 * 
 * Prepared Statement Interface -> Used to create SQL statements and Queries sanitizes input and protects them against SQL injection
 * 
 * Callable Statement Interface -> Used to call Stored Procedures
 * 
 * ResultSet Interface -> objects that represent the data returned from our sql statements or queries
 * 
 * */

/*
 * We are going to maintain and observe a single connection object

 * If a connection does exists, we will return that.
